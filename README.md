This is a python code to find award flight availabilities for ANA, a Japanese airline. 
The availability is limited and can not see on a calendar, so I used selenium to manually search it.
You just need your ANA ID and password to execute this code.

The variables are,,,
3 letter codes for cities you fly between
Boarding class
The dates for your flights, which are in the middle of the code, not at the top.
